# lamarck

Provides the data from [Garret Heaton's](https://github.com/powdahound) excellent [ec2instances.info](https://github.com/powdahound/ec2instances.info) project in Clojure form for munging in your application. At [MixRadio](http://dev.mixrad.io/blog/) we use this library to help us estimate our EC2 costs.

## Lamarck who?

[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck), according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud#Luke_Howard_and_Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck) he worked on cloud classification. It seemed vaguely appropriate!
